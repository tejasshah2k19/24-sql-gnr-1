select * from employees;
select avg(salary) from employees group by position ;

select position,avg(salary) from employees group by position having avg(salary) > 40000;



when we want club data using a common group , by city , by lastName , by department 
        we will use group by 

if you want to add condition in group by query then we need to use having 
can we use where in group by query ? yes 
how ? 
you can use before group by 


select position,avg(salary) from employees where salary > 20000  group by position having avg(salary) > 40000;



find -> count -> group by ->
